This is NOT a real release. Must considered just as a stable snapshot
from cvs repository. Read the INSTALL.txt file and web pages at
http://c-icap.sourceforge.net/ for information about how to configure.

COMMENTS:
*c-icap is more tested in Linux systems. However compiles and runs at least
in FreeBSD 6.x and possibly in other platforms. At regular times I am
testing it also in solaris 10. I was not able to check this release due
to a problem in my solaris machine. I will do it soon...

*ipv6 support for Linux and Solaris looks that works OK but it is not
enough tested.

*Although I was able to compile c-icap with IPv6 support in FreeBSD 5.x-6.x
it was not possible for me to make it to work. Maybe becouse of bugs in
implementation maybe becouse of my inability to correctly setup the ipv6
in FreeBSD.

NEW FEATURES:
* ServiceAlias: They are useful in the case the icap client has hardcoded
the service name. As an example in the default config  file there is the
avscan service alias which can used by samba vscan-icap module.

* You can send commands to the c-icap server from command line using the
following syndax:
   echo -n command_name  > /var/run/c-icap.ctl
Currently the following commands are implemented:
  "stop":        The c-icap will shutdown
  "reconfigure": The service will reread the config file without the need
	         for stop and restart the c-icap server. The services will
		 be reinitialized
  "relog":       This command causes c_icap to close and reopen the log files.
                 This is very useful for log rotation if you have services that
                 take a long time to start, such as srv_classify can.
  "srv_clamav:dbreload"
	       : It reloads the clamav virus database

Examples:
 - To reconfigure c-icap:
      echo -n "reconfigure" > /var/run/c-icap.ctl
 - To close and reopen all log files (for log rotation, etc.)
      echo -n "relog" > /var/run/c-icap.ctl
 - To reload clamav virusdb without stoping the c-icap:
      echo -n "srv_clamav:dbreload" > /var/run/c-icap.ctl
