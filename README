The c-icap server                         http://c-icap.sourceforge.net/

c-icap is an implementation of an ICAP server. It can be used with HTTP
proxies that support the ICAP protocol to implement content adaptation
and filtering services.

Most of the commercial HTTP proxies must support the ICAP protocol. The
open source Squid proxy server supports it.

Major features:
  - ICAP over TLS support
  - C API for developing custom content adaptation and filtering services
  - plugins interface
  - LDAP integration
  - simple ICAP client API
